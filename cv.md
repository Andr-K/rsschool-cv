## About

I learn programming to be able to develop my own software. First of all, I focus on quality. Therefore, I try to put as much effort as I can to understand new infromation well from the very beginning. My main priorities are efficiency, accuracy and tolerance to the people around me. I am good at communicating with people, understanding their needs and managing. Recently, I noticed that my quality-first approach is also usefull in programming. What often helps me a lot is my ability to understand sophisticated concepts relatively fast.
My working experience is not related to programming but it teached me usefull skills like:

1. As an assistant mechanical engineer, I had to understand how the vessels work by applying my theoretical knowledge in practice.
2. When working as sales specialist, I learned how to speak with people in order to undestand their needs
3. When I was a marketing manager, I found out what drives people minds the most and how to manage a team.

On each of these positions it was essential to assimilate a lot of new information in a timely manner and utilise it propperly. It is hard but also very interesting and fun for me.
