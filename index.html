        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I learn programming to be able to develop my own software. First of all, I focus on quality. 
          Therefore, I try to put as much effort as I can to understand new infromation well from the very beginning. 
          My main priorities are efficiency, accuracy and tolerance to the people around me. 
          I am good at communicating with people, understanding their needs and managing. 
          Recently, I noticed that my quality-first approach is also usefull in programming. 
          What often helps me a lot is my ability to understand sophisticated concepts relatively fast.
          My working experience is not related to programming but it teached me usefull skills like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>As an assistant mechanical engineer, I had to understand how the vessels work by applying my theoretical knowledge in practice.</li>
          <li>When working as sales specialist, I learned how to speak with people in order to undestand their needs.</li>
          <li>When I was a marketing manager, I found out what drives people minds the most and how to manage a team.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On each of these positions it was essential to assimilate a lot of new information in a timely manner and utilise it propperly. It is hard but also very interesting and fun for me.
